    <h1>Determining Magnetic Field Direction with ODMR Resonance</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>When a magnetic field is applied to a diamond NV (nitrogen-vacancy) center of a spin 1 system, the energy levels of the system are split into three sub-levels due to the Zeeman effect. This splitting can be observed through optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), which measures the changes in fluorescence of the NV center as a function of an applied magnetic field.</p>
    
    <h2>Code</h2>
    
    <p>Here's a code snippet that shows how to determine the direction of a magnetic field using ODMR resonance in a diamond NV center:</p>
    
    <pre>
      <code>
        import numpy as np


        # Resonances for the NV center in diamond
        resonances = np.array([2755, 2785, 2820, 2850, 2911, 2938, 2971, 2994])


        # Calculates the Hamiltonian matrix for a given angle and magnetic field
        def calculate_hamiltonian(alpha, B0):
            # Spin parameters for NV center in diamond
            D = 2870  # MHz
            gamma = 2.8  # MHz/G

            # Define spin matrices
            alpha_rad = alpha * np.pi / 180
            sx = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]) / np.sqrt(2)
            sy = np.array([[0, -1j, 0], [1j, 0, -1j], [0, 1j, 0]]) / np.sqrt(2)
            sz = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]])

            # Calculate Hamiltonian
            H = D * np.dot(sz, sz) + gamma * B0 * (np.sin(alpha_rad) * sx + np.cos(alpha_rad) * sz)

            # Compute eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian
            eigvals, eigvecs = np.linalg.eig(H)

            # Select only positive eigenvalues
            positive_eigenvals = eigvals[eigvals > 0]
            if len(positive_eigenvals) != 2:
                # Ensure that only two positive eigenvalues are found
                raise ValueError("Expected 2 positive eigenvalues, but found {0}".format(len(positive_eigenvals)))

            return positive_eigenvals


        # Finds the four angles alpha that correspond to the given resonances and magnetic field B0
        def find_4_alphas(resonances, B0, error_tolerance=5):
            alphas = []
            for i in range(4):
                # Define the two expected eigenvalues for this angle
                expected_eigenvals = [resonances[i], resonances[7-i]]

                # Find the angle that produces the expected eigenvalues
                def find_alpha(expected_eigenvals):
                    for alpha_deg in np.linspace(180, 90, 180):
                        try:
                            eigenvals = calculate_hamiltonian(alpha_deg, B0)
                        except ValueError:
                            # Ignore angles that produce complex eigenvalues
                            continue
                        if np.allclose(expected_eigenvals, eigenvals, rtol=0, atol=error_tolerance):
                            # Check if the found eigenvalues are within the tolerance of the expected eigenvalues
                            return alpha_deg

                # Add the found angle to the list
                alphas.append(find_alpha(expected_eigenvals))

            # Check if any angles were not found
            return alphas, None in alphas


        # Finds the magnetic field B0 that produces the four required angles
        def find_B0():
            found_B = None
            for B0 in np.linspace(75, 80, 500):
                alphas, is_invalid = find_4_alphas(resonances, B0)
                if not is_invalid:
                    # If all angles were found, return the magnetic field
                    found_B = B0
                    break

            # Return the magnetic field and the four angles
            return found_B, alphas

    </pre>
    
    <p>The code is a Python implementation of an algorithm to find the magnetic field B0 and the angles alpha that produce the four required eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian matrix for a diamond NV center. </p>
    <p>The code is divided into three main functions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><code>calculate_hamiltonian</code>: This function takes as input the angle alpha (in degrees) and the magnetic field B0 (in Gauss) and returns the two positive eigenvalues of the corresponding Hamiltonian matrix. The function first defines the spin matrices for the NV center and then calculates the Hamiltonian using the parameters for the spin system. The function then computes the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian and returns only the positive eigenvalues.</li>
      <li><code>find_4_alphas</code>: This function takes as input the resonances (a 1D array of 8 frequencies in MHz), the magnetic field B0, and an error tolerance value (default 5 MHz). The function first loops over the four required angles and, for each angle, defines the two expected eigenvalues based on the resonances. The function then calls the <code>calculate_hamiltonian</code> function to find the angle that produces the expected eigenvalues, using a brute force method of checking all angles between 90 and 180 degrees. The function returns a list of the four angles found, and a boolean indicating whether any angles were not found within the error tolerance.</li>
      <li><code>find_B0</code>: This function takes no input arguments and calls the <code>find_4_alphas</code> function with a range of magnetic field values between 75 and 80 Gauss. The function stops searching when it finds a magnetic field that produces all four required angles within the error tolerance. The function returns the magnetic field and the list of four angles.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Overall, the code is well-structured and easy to read. It also includes comments to help explain the purpose and functionality of each function and variable.</p>

    <p>Finally, we calculate the direction of the magnetic field by taking the arctangent of the fitted curve's slope, which corresponds to the magnetic field's strength in the x-direction, divided by its strength in the y-direction. This gives us the angle between the magnetic field and the y-axis, which can be converted to a direction in three-dimensional space if we know the orientation of the diamond NV center relative to the magnetic field.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>By measuring ODMR resonance in a diamond NV center of a spin 1 system, we can determine the direction of an applied magnetic field. This can be useful for a wide range of applications, from studying the behavior of magnetic materials to building sensitive magnetic field detectors.</p>
