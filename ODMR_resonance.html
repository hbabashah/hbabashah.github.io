    <h1>Determining Magnetic Field Direction with ODMR Resonance</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>When a magnetic field is applied to a diamond NV (nitrogen-vacancy) center of a spin 1 system, the energy levels of the system are split into three sub-levels due to the Zeeman effect. This splitting can be observed through optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), which measures the changes in fluorescence of the NV center as a function of an applied magnetic field.</p>
    
    <h2>Code</h2>
    
    <p>Here's a code snippet that shows how to determine the direction of a magnetic field using ODMR resonance in a diamond NV center:</p>
    
    <pre>
      <code>
      import numpy as np


      resonances = np.array([2755, 2785, 2820, 2850, 2911, 2938, 2971, 2994])


      def calculate_hamiltonian(alpha, B0):
          D = 2870  # MHz
          gamma = 2.8  # MHz/G
          alpha_rad = alpha * np.pi / 180
          sx = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]) / np.sqrt(2)
          sy = np.array([[0, -1j, 0], [1j, 0, -1j], [0, 1j, 0]]) / np.sqrt(2)
          sz = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]])
          H = D * np.dot(sz, sz) + gamma * B0 * (np.sin(alpha_rad) * sx + np.cos(alpha_rad) * sz)
          eigvals, eigvecs = np.linalg.eig(H)
          positive_eigenvals = eigvals[eigvals > 0]
          if len(positive_eigenvals) != 2:
              raise ValueError("Expected 2 positive eigenvalues, but found {0}".format(len(positive_eigenvals)))
          return positive_eigenvals


      def find_4_alphas(resonances, B0, error_tolerance=5):
          alphas = []
          for i in range(4):
              expected_eigenvals = [resonances[i], resonances[7-i]]
              def find_alpha(expected_eigenvals):
                  for alpha_deg in np.linspace(180, 90, 180):
                      try:
                          eigenvals = calculate_hamiltonian(alpha_deg, B0)
                      except ValueError:
                          continue
                      if np.allclose(expected_eigenvals, eigenvals, rtol=0, atol=error_tolerance):
                          return alpha_deg
              alphas.append(find_alpha(expected_eigenvals))
          return alphas, None in alphas


      def find_B0():
          found_B = None
          for B0 in np.linspace(75, 80, 500):
              alphas, is_invalid = find_4_alphas(resonances, B0)
              if not is_invalid:
                  found_B = B0
                  break
          return found_B, al

    <p>In this code, we first import the necessary libraries (NumPy and SciPy's curve_fit function) to perform the analysis. We then define the resonance curve function, which models the expected ODMR response as a function of magnetic field strength. We generate some test data and fit the resonance curve to the data using the curve_fit function.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, we calculate the direction of the magnetic field by taking the arctangent of the fitted curve's slope, which corresponds to the magnetic field's strength in the x-direction, divided by its strength in the y-direction. This gives us the angle between the magnetic field and the y-axis, which can be converted to a direction in three-dimensional space if we know the orientation of the diamond NV center relative to the magnetic field.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>By measuring ODMR resonance in a diamond NV center of a spin 1 system, we can determine the direction of an applied magnetic field. This can be useful for a wide range of applications, from studying the behavior of magnetic materials to building sensitive magnetic field detectors.</p>
