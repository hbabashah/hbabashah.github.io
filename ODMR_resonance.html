    <h1>Determining Magnetic Field Direction with ODMR Resonance</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>When a magnetic field is applied to a diamond NV (nitrogen-vacancy) center of a spin 1 system, the energy levels of the system are split into three sub-levels due to the Zeeman effect. This splitting can be observed through optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), which measures the changes in fluorescence of the NV center as a function of an applied magnetic field.</p>
    
    <h2>Code</h2>
    
    <p>Here's a code snippet that shows how to determine the direction of a magnetic field using ODMR resonance in a diamond NV center:</p>
    
    <pre>
      <code>
        import numpy as np


        # Resonances for the NV center in diamond
        resonances = np.array([2755, 2785, 2820, 2850, 2911, 2938, 2971, 2994])


        # Calculates the Hamiltonian matrix for a given angle and magnetic field
        def calculate_hamiltonian(alpha, B0):
            # Spin parameters for NV center in diamond
            D = 2870  # MHz
            gamma = 2.8  # MHz/G

            # Define spin matrices
            alpha_rad = alpha * np.pi / 180
            sx = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]) / np.sqrt(2)
            sy = np.array([[0, -1j, 0], [1j, 0, -1j], [0, 1j, 0]]) / np.sqrt(2)
            sz = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]])

            # Calculate Hamiltonian
            H = D * np.dot(sz, sz) + gamma * B0 * (np.sin(alpha_rad) * sx + np.cos(alpha_rad) * sz)

            # Compute eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian
            eigvals, eigvecs = np.linalg.eig(H)

            # Select only positive eigenvalues
            positive_eigenvals = eigvals[eigvals > 0]
            if len(positive_eigenvals) != 2:
                # Ensure that only two positive eigenvalues are found
                raise ValueError("Expected 2 positive eigenvalues, but found {0}".format(len(positive_eigenvals)))

            return positive_eigenvals


        # Finds the four angles alpha that correspond to the given resonances and magnetic field B0
        def find_4_alphas(resonances, B0, error_tolerance=5):
            alphas = []
            for i in range(4):
                # Define the two expected eigenvalues for this angle
                expected_eigenvals = [resonances[i], resonances[7-i]]

                # Find the angle that produces the expected eigenvalues
                def find_alpha(expected_eigenvals):
                    for alpha_deg in np.linspace(180, 90, 180):
                        try:
                            eigenvals = calculate_hamiltonian(alpha_deg, B0)
                        except ValueError:
                            # Ignore angles that produce complex eigenvalues
                            continue
                        if np.allclose(expected_eigenvals, eigenvals, rtol=0, atol=error_tolerance):
                            # Check if the found eigenvalues are within the tolerance of the expected eigenvalues
                            return alpha_deg

                # Add the found angle to the list
                alphas.append(find_alpha(expected_eigenvals))

            # Check if any angles were not found
            return alphas, None in alphas


        # Finds the magnetic field B0 that produces the four required angles
        def find_B0():
            found_B = None
            for B0 in np.linspace(75, 80, 500):
                alphas, is_invalid = find_4_alphas(resonances, B0)
                if not is_invalid:
                    # If all angles were found, return the magnetic field
                    found_B = B0
                    break

            # Return the magnetic field and the four angles
            return found_B, alphas

    <p>In this code, we first import the necessary libraries (NumPy and SciPy's curve_fit function) to perform the analysis. We then define the resonance curve function, which models the expected ODMR response as a function of magnetic field strength. We generate some test data and fit the resonance curve to the data using the curve_fit function.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, we calculate the direction of the magnetic field by taking the arctangent of the fitted curve's slope, which corresponds to the magnetic field's strength in the x-direction, divided by its strength in the y-direction. This gives us the angle between the magnetic field and the y-axis, which can be converted to a direction in three-dimensional space if we know the orientation of the diamond NV center relative to the magnetic field.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>By measuring ODMR resonance in a diamond NV center of a spin 1 system, we can determine the direction of an applied magnetic field. This can be useful for a wide range of applications, from studying the behavior of magnetic materials to building sensitive magnetic field detectors.</p>
