	<h1>Welcome to the Physics Lab Tutorial!</h1>
	<p>This website provides tutorials on how to use various hardware and software in the lab using Python. The tutorials cover National Instruments (NI) cards using the PyDAQ-mx package, Telegram package for plotting and sending data, and some useful programming skills.</p>
	
	<h2>NI Cards using PyDAQ-mx</h2>
	<p>NI cards provide hardware support for data acquisition tasks such as capturing and measuring analogue signals, and detecting digital events. The PyDAQ-mx package provides a Python interface for controlling NI cards, making it easy to set up and perform data acquisition tasks.</p>

	<h2>Telegram Integration</h2>
	<p>Telegram is a messaging app that can be used to send messages, photos, videos, and files to other users. The Python Telegram Bot API provides a way to interact with Telegram bots using Python. This can be used to send plots and other data to your phone or other devices after a measurement is complete.</p>
