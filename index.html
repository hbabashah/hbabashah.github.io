	<h1>Welcome to the Physics Lab Tutorial!</h1>
<p>Welcome to our website! We offer step-by-step tutorials on using hardware and software in the lab with Python. Our tutorials cover a range of topics, including how to use National Instruments (NI) cards with the PyDAQ-mx package, how to plot and send data using the Telegram package, and useful programming skills.</p>

<p>If you want more information about our website, feel free to visit <a href="https://github.com/hbabashah/hbabashah.github.io">www.github.io</a>. Additionally, you can check out our contributions to Qudi by following this link: <a href="https://github.com/hbabashah">main git</a>.</p>	
	<h2>NI Cards using PyDAQ-mx</h2>
	<p>NI cards provide hardware support for data acquisition tasks such as capturing and measuring analogue signals, and detecting digital events. The PyDAQ-mx package provides a Python interface for controlling NI cards, making it easy to set up and perform data acquisition tasks.</p>

	<h2>Determining Magnetic Field Direction with ODMR Resonance</h2>
	<p> Determining Magnetic Field Direction with ODMR (Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance) Resonance involves using the properties of a diamond NV (nitrogen-vacancy) center of a spin 1 system to determine the direction of an applied magnetic field.

When a magnetic field is applied to a diamond NV center, the energy levels of the system split into three sub-levels due to the Zeeman effect. This splitting can be observed through ODMR, which measures the changes in fluorescence of the NV center as a function of an applied magnetic field.</p>

	<h2>Telegram Integration</h2>
	<p>Telegram is a messaging app that can be used to send messages, photos, videos, and files to other users. The Python Telegram Bot API provides a way to interact with Telegram bots using Python. This can be used to send plots and other data to your phone or other devices after a measurement is complete.</p>
