	<h1>Welcome to the Physics Lab Tutorial!</h1>
<p>Welcome to our website! We offer step-by-step tutorials on using hardware and software in the lab with Python. Our tutorials cover a range of topics, including how to use National Instruments (NI) cards with the PyDAQ-mx package, how to plot and send data using the Telegram package, and useful programming skills.

	<h2>QUDI</h2>
	<p>Qudi [1], initially released in 2017, integrates modules for performing ODMR experiments, instrument control, and real-time data acquisition and processing. It enables fast imaging by scanning the beam position while collecting luminescence. Qudi can locate ODMR emitters and track them during acquisition, compensating for sample drift. It is particularly useful for studying nanoparticles in liquid suspensions. 
		It provides useful tools for interfacing a scanning confocal microscope by controlling piezo-based nanopositioning stages or scanning mirrors and collecting the optical emission signal.Possibilities include in-plane scanning (xy), z-stack acquisitions (to obtain 3D images), out of plane cross-sections (xz) or (yz) as well as any other direction cuts depending on the wiring and instrument. 
		Associated to confocal microscope hardware, Qudi can locate and track ODMR emitters, compensating for sample drift. This feature is particularly interesting when dealing with nanoparticles in a liquid suspension such as in biomedical applications.Qudi efficiently controls the instruments required for acquiring CW ODMR spectra and determining spin resonance frequencies. Real-time fitting of analytical curves on ODMR data allows for adjustment of acquisition parameters and quick sharing of results with collaborators.
		In addition to the CW ODMR signal, Qudi is designed for the study of spin dynamics with pulse sequences such as for measuring longitudinal spin relaxation curves (T_1), Rabi oscilations, Ramsey (T2*) or Hahn Echo (T2) sequences. It can control the pulse generator for triggering laser and MW pulses in a synchronous manner with the collection of the photoluminescence. It also enables the design of complex pulse sequences, 
		including dynamical decoupling sequences. Predefined methods like XY8 pulses are available via the graphical interface, and new pulse sequences can be easily added to the program.<p>
			<p> The initial version of Qudi was focused for experiments on single quantum emitters, thus requiring digital single photon counting modules as well as time tagging electronics in the pulsed measurements. In order to broaden its contextual applicability, %and especially to NV ensembles, 
				we added several features. </p>

	<h2>Determining Magnetic Field Direction with ODMR Resonance</h2>
	<p> Determining Magnetic Field Direction with ODMR (Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance) Resonance involves using the properties of a diamond NV (nitrogen-vacancy) center of a spin 1 system to determine the direction of an applied magnetic field.

When a magnetic field is applied to a diamond NV center, the energy levels of the system split into three sub-levels due to the Zeeman effect. This splitting can be observed through ODMR, which measures the changes in fluorescence of the NV center as a function of an applied magnetic field.</p>

	<h2>Telegram Integration</h2>
	<p>Telegram is a messaging app that can be used to send messages, photos, videos, and files to other users. The Python Telegram Bot API provides a way to interact with Telegram bots using Python. This can be used to send plots and other data to your phone or other devices after a measurement is complete.</p>
