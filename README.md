# Physics Lab Tutorial
Welcome to the Physics Lab Tutorial! This is a website that provides tutorials on how to use various hardware and software in the lab using Python. The tutorials cover National Instruments (NI) cards using the PyDAQ-mx package, Telegram package for plotting and sending data, and some useful programming skills.

## NI Cards using PyDAQ-mx
NI cards provide hardware support for data acquisition tasks such as capturing and measuring analogue signals, and detecting digital events. The PyDAQ-mx package provides a Python interface for controlling NI cards, making it easy to set up and perform data acquisition tasks.

The following tutorials are available for NI Cards using PyDAQ-mx:

- Analogue Acquisition with PyDAQ-mx for NI Cards
- Digital Acquisition with PyDAQ-mx for NI Cards
- Trigger Acquisition with PyDAQ-mx for NI Cards
- Photon Counting with PyDAQ-mx for NI Cards
- Pulse generation with PyDAQ-mx for NI Cards
## Telegram Integration
Telegram is a messaging app that can be used to send messages, photos, videos, and files to other users. The Python Telegram Bot API provides a way to interact with Telegram bots using Python. This can be used to send plots and other data to your phone or other devices after a measurement is complete.

The following tutorial is available for Telegram integration:
