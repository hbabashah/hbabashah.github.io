	<h1>Digital Acquisition with PyDAQ-mx for NI Cards</h1>
	<p>This tutorial explains how to perform digital acquisition using PyDAQ-mx in Python for NI cards.</p>
	
	<h2>What is Digital Acquisition?</h2>
	<p>Digital acquisition is the process of capturing and measuring discrete, digital signals such as on/off signals or binary data. NI cards provide hardware support for digital acquisition and can be used with PyDAQ-mx to easily perform digital acquisition tasks in Python.</p>
	
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	<p>In order to get started with digital acquisition using PyDAQ-mx and an NI card, you will need:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An NI data acquisition card with digital input channels</li>
		<li>The PyDAQ-mx package installed</li>
		<li>A compatible version of Python installed on your computer</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Performing Digital Acquisition with PyDAQ-mx</h2>
	<p>Performing digital acquisition with PyDAQ-mx involves creating a task, configuring the channels and timing, starting the task, and reading the acquired data. Here's an example script:</p>
	<pre>
	import PyDAQmx
	
	task = PyDAQmx.Task()
	
	task.CreateDIChan("Dev1/port0/line0:7", "", PyDAQmx.DAQmx_Val_ChanForAllLines)
	task.CfgSampClkTiming("", 1000.0, PyDAQmx.DAQmx_Val_Rising, PyDAQmx.DAQmx_Val_FiniteSamps, 1000)
	
	task.Start()
	
	data = numpy.zeros((1000,), dtype=numpy.uint32)
	task.ReadDigitalU32(1000, 10.0, PyDAQmx.DAQmx_Val_GroupByScanNumber, data, 1000, PyDAQmx._byref(PyDAQmx.int32()), None)
	
	task.Stop()
	task.Clear()
	</pre>
	<p>This script creates a task for digital input channels on port 0, lines 0 to 7, configures the sampling clock to run at 1000 Hz, starts the task, reads 1000 samples of digital data, stops the task, and releases the task resources.</p>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Performing digital acquisition using PyDAQ-mx in Python for NI cards is a powerful tool for capturing and processing digital signals. With PyDAQ-mx and Python, you can easily set up and control digital acquisition tasks. We hope this tutorial has been helpful in getting you started with digital acquisition using PyDAQ-mx.</p>
