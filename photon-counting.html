	<h1>Photon Counting with NI Card</h1>
	<p>This tutorial explains how to perform photon counting using an NI card in Python.</p>
	
	<h2>What is Photon Counting?</h2>
	<p>Photon counting is the process of counting the number of photons detected by a photon detector. NI cards provide hardware support for photon counting, which can be used with Python to easily perform photon counting for various applications, such as fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).</p>
	
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	<p>In order to get started with photon counting using an NI card in Python, you will need:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An NI data acquisition card with analogue input channels</li>
		<li>A photon detector with analogue output</li>
		<li>A compatible version of Python installed on your computer</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Performing Photon Counting with NI Card</h2>
	<p>Performing photon counting using an NI card involves creating a task, configuring the channels and timing, starting the task, and reading the acquired data. Here's an example script:</p>
	<pre>
	import numpy as np
	import os
	import time
	import PyDAQmx as daq

	def acquire_signal(channel_name, file_path, save_data=True, acquisition_time=1, laser_length=200e-6, resolution=0.5e-6):
	    """
	    Acquires a signal from a DAQ device and saves the data to a file.

	    Parameters:
	    channel_name (str): The name of the DAQ channel to acquire data from.
	    file_path (str): The path to the file where the data should be saved.
	    save_data (bool): Whether to save the acquired data to a file. Defaults to True.
	    acquisition_time (float): The duration of the acquisition in seconds. Defaults to 1.
	    laser_length (float): The length of the laser pulse in seconds. Defaults to 200e-6.
	    resolution (float): The resolution of the acquisition in seconds. Defaults to 0.5e-6.

	    Returns:
	    A tuple containing the acquired data and the time scale of the data.
	    """
